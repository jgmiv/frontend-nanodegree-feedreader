# feedreader

# Introduction:

This project was to learn how to use [Jasmine's](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html#section-Asynchronous_Support) test suite to help write code that works the first time.  To do this you write test cases on how the code should work and run this code using Jasmine.  If it fails, go back to the drawing board otherwise move on to writing other code.

# Details:

We took a mock up blog and built test suites to run different tests based on how certain parts of the site are supposed to act.  

# Files details:

- `index.html`- file contains the html code.
- `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`- file contains the test suites that test javascript code of the blog page.
- `css/styles.css` contains the header, color and font properties that are applied to the project.
- `js/app.js` contains the code that creates animations, loads the feeds and makes thing happen.

# How to Run:

Once project is cloned to your machine, open the file [index.html](index.html) in your web browser and it
will be displayed.  You can see the different test suites and their test results.  You can also enter the [jasmine/spec/feedreader.js](jasmine/spec/feedreader.js) and try your hand at writing test suites.  Refresh the browser to see if the suites pass or fail.
